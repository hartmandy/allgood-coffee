            We are a family owned small business started in 2013. We got our
            start many years ago at our first shop, Sweetwater Coffeehouse in
            Sautee-Nacoochee, GA before selling the business and moving to
            Western North Carolina. Like many, we were drawn to this area by
            itâ€™s natural beauty, and the warm welcoming, like minded people. We
            are very pleased to have a location in Weaverville, NC, and are
            enjoying becoming a part of the community!
